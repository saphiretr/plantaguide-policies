    <h1>PlantaGuide Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>

    <p>PlantaGuide ("we", "us", "the application") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use our application and how we use that information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our application only collects the following information to perform its function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Images for Identification:</strong> Images of plants that you select from your gallery or capture with your camera at that moment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our application does not collect or request any other personal data such as your name, email address, or location.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use and Share Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plant Identification:</strong> The image you upload is sent to a third-party service, the <strong>PlantNet API</strong>, to provide the plant identification service. This process is mandatory for analyzing the image and returning a result to you. For PlantNet's own privacy policy, you can visit the <a href="https://plantnet.org/privacy-policy/">PlantNet website</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Parties:</strong> Other than sending the image to the PlantNet API for identification, your image or any other data is not shared with any other third-party person, institution, or service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The data obtained from the identification result (plant name, score, a copy of the image, etc.) is stored securely only on your own device (your phone) to be displayed in your "History" and "Favorites" lists. We or any other third party cannot access this data.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>You can permanently delete all data stored on your device at any time using the delete functions available on the "History" and "Favorites" screens.</p>
